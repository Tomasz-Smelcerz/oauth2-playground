Introduction to Oauth2

What is oauth2

Definition

The need for delegating authorization is nothing new, actually.
 - Two examples from "real world".
   - valet parking
   - access cards
                           
But how do we solve such problems in modern IT world?
 - Two "example" apps.
   - Printer app
   - Calendar integration app
- 1 no such problem (client/server world)
- 2 very hard (early systems, no api, only web-scraping)
- 3 first apis, full-access only (not very secure)
  - why are password not very secure?
- 4 first delegated authorization apis (proprietary, harder to integrate)
- 5 OAuth as an attempt to standardize

We are talking about OAuth 2 here.
